Contact:        Linus Lüssing <linus.luessing@web.de>
Description:
                Defines the interval in milliseconds in which batman
                emits probing packets for neighbor sensing (ELP).

Contact:        Marek Lindner <mareklindner@neomailbox.ch>
Description:
                Indicates the status of <iface> as it is seen by batman.

Description:
                The /sys/class/net/<iface>/batman-adv/mesh_iface file
                displays the batman mesh interface this <iface>
                currently is associated with.

What:           /sys/class/net/<iface>/batman-adv/throughput_override
Date:           Feb 2014
Contact:        Antonio Quartulli <a@unstable.cc>
description:
                Defines the throughput value to be used by B.A.T.M.A.N. V
                when estimating the link throughput using this interface.
                If the value is set to 0 then batman-adv will try to
                estimate the throughput by itself.

Date:           Sep 2013
Contact:        Linus Lüssing <linus.luessing@web.de>
Description:
                With this option set incoming multicast payload frames on
                <iface> are not being rebroadcasted on <iface> again. This
                option should be set on links which are known to be transitive
                and symmetric only, for instance point-to-point wifi longshots
                or wired links. Using this option wrongly is going to
                break your mesh network, use at your own risk!
